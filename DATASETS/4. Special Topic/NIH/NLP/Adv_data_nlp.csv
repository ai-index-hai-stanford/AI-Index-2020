A cochlear implant can be surgically inserted into the cochlea to electrically stimulate the nerves responsible for hearing; but trauma resulting from the surgica insertion can result in decreased implant effectiveness and loss of residual hearing.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate that magnetic guidance of cochlear implants during surgical insertion will reduce trauma compared to traditional manual insertion.,NIDCD,9530617,27-Jul-2018,PA-13-302,5R01DC013168-05,5,R01,DC,13168,5,,"MILLER, ROGER",1-Aug-2014,31-Jul-2021,"Bioengineering of Neuroscience, Vision and Low Vision Technologies Study Section (BNVT) ",,10196795,"ABBOTT, JAKE ",Not Applicable,2,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),9095365,US,40.76776,-111.832926,514002,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING,84112-8930,UNITED STATES,,1-Aug-2018,31-Jul-2021,173,Research Projects,2018,NIDCD,291051,80665,371716,

According to the National Spinal Cord InjuryStatistical Center approximately 160;000 people in the USA are living with complete or partial tetraplegia as of2014. A majority of these patients still have sufficiently intact cortex to plan movements; but they are unable toexecute them. Thus they are candidates for assistance using cortical brain-machine interfaces. Moreover;these prosthetics have applicability beyond spinal cord lesion and can also help patients with motor disabilitiesfrom stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Better understanding of the cortical grasp pathway (aim 1);providing somatosensory feedback with intracortical microstimulation (aim 2); and combining intracorticalstimulation feedback with brain control (aim 3) promise to greatly benefit patients.,NINDS,9548752,19-Sep-2018,RFA-NS-16-008,5U01NS098975-03,5,U01,NS,98975,3,,"GNADT, JAMES W",30-Sep-2016,31-Aug-2021,Special Emphasis Panel (ZNS1-SRB-T (11)),,6252531,"ANDERSEN, RICHARD A",Not Applicable,27,NONE,9584210,US,34.134337,-118.126525,1073501,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,PASADENA,CA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,91125-0001,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2018,31-Aug-2021,853,Research Projects,2018,NINDS,574653,176566,651365,

Relevance StatementAbout 1 man in 6 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime; making it the most commoncancer affecting men and second in the overall population; accounting for about 33% of incident cancer casesin men. While Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) tests and improved imaging for early detection are continuallyadvancing; the majority of therapies available are radical. These include surgery (open and robotic); externalbeam radiation therapy; and brachytherapy. More recently; ablation of the entire prostate gland withcryotherapy (freezing) or high intensity focused ultrasound has been used. Despite advances in theeffectiveness of these therapies; precise targeting of the ablator device and real time monitoring and control ofthe zone of necrosis remain unsolved problems. Recent studies have demonstrated significant advantages ofinterstitial ultrasound ablators; most notably the capability to create and control treatment energy distributions(i.e. size and shape treatment zone) for conformable treatments and preserving critical non-targeted tissues.We will develop and implement precise ultrasound ablation and 3D ultrasound image guidance that is widelyaffordable; as an option to watchful waiting for patients with early stage prostate cancer and patients withlocalized focal or dominant tumor regions within the prostate. Ultrasound image guidance combined withinformation from biopsy maps and/or multi-parametric MRI will guide and precisely deliver this minimallyinvasive treatment device to the diseased regions of the gland. There are clinical differences of opinion withrespect to treatment of microscopic disease. Here; it is important to emphasize that a localized treatment forfocal prostate disease has been long sought after and that the standard of care for breast disease isconservative surgery followed by localized radiation; i.e. focal therapy. Our proposed focal disease therapyplus margin treatment is minimally invasive and readily followed by PSA testing. This precision image-guidedtherapeutic ultrasound approach can treat focal disease or whole gland; and may provide a needed alternativeto those patients who have failed radiotherapy; are at high risk for surgery; or who seek alternatives for localcontrol. Further; all other treatment options; including radical prostatectomy (open or robotic); radiotherapy;other thermal ablation; remain viable alternatives. The objective of this research is to develop new conformalhigh-intensity interstitial ultrasound therapy devices and spatial treatment control capabilities specific forprostate delivered using noninvasive image based treatment monitoring; and intraprocedural patient-specifictreatment optimization for precision image-guided localized therapy for clinical study.,NCI,9757727,29-Aug-2019,PAR-17-093,5R01CA230323-02,5,R01,CA,230323,2,,"BAKER, HOUSTON",7-Aug-2018,31-Jul-2023,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-SBIB-Q (57)R),,8495898,"BURDETTE, EVERETTE C ","DIEDERICH, CHRIS JOHN",13,Unavailable,606222896,US,40.074346,-88.249841,4100601,"ACOUSTIC MEDSYSTEMS, INC.",Savoy,IL,Domestic For-Profits,61874-9510,UNITED STATES,,1-Aug-2019,31-Jul-2020,394,Research Projects,2019,NCI,447252,119137,566389,

The VA supplies over 80;000 new wheelchairs annually at a5.2% annual growth rate. However; matching a Veteran to an inappropriate or low-qualitywheelchair may result in injuries/accidents due to tips and falls when driving in commonenvironments; particularly curb-ramps; uneven surfaces; and outdoor terrains. In some cases;these accidents lead to hospitalization. Two major adverse consequences of these accidentsare lower community participation and abandonment of their wheelchairs. The goal of this CDA-1 project is the optimization of a novel robotic wheelchair to prevent tip/falls in commonenvironments. The results of this study will provide evidence to enhance the safety and mobilityof VwD when using MEBot and a research platform to improve mobility assistive technology.,VA,9833708,4-Nov-2019,RFA-RX-18-015,1IK1RX003076-01A1,1,IK1,VA,3076,1,A1,Unavailable,1-Nov-2019,31-Oct-2021,Career Development Program - Panel I (RRD8) ,,14525673,"CANDIOTTI, JORGE ",Not Applicable,18,Unavailable,33127569,US,40.479754,-79.90176,481080,VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION,PITTSBURGH,PA,Independent Hospitals,15240-1003,UNITED STATES,,1-Nov-2019,31-Oct-2020,999,Others,2020,,,,,

Brain-Machine Interfaces allow one to use one?s volitionally-controlled thoughts to control an external device; be it acomputer cursor; a robotic arm; or one?s own muscles. The majority of research to create a reliable brainmachine interface has been directed at those that are severely paralyzed and ?locked-in?. Specifically; thosewith spinal cord injury; stroke; and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) would gain the most. An increasingpercentage of these patients are veterans. In the first year after a high tetraplegia injury the average expensesare about $1M and the lifetime expected costs are between $2.4M and $4.4M. Brain computer interfaces havethe potential to enable these individuals to utilize many more useful assistive devices; and improve the qualityof life for a wide spectrum of disabled Veterans.

Following a stroke; the restoration or improvement ofwalking is a high-ranking goal among patients; but only about half of the population is able to return to typicallevels of community ambulation. The resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with adecline in quality of life. Gait instability is a common contributor to limited mobility through either an increasedfall-risk or fear of falling; but current interventions to address post-stroke gait instability have had limitedsuccess. The proposed project will develop and conduct initial testing of a novel elastic force-field designed toimprove post-stroke gait stability through targeted motor learning. The results of these experiments will serveas the basis for the development of novel gait rehabilitation techniques; which have the potential to increasethe quality of life of thousands of Veterans and save millions of dollars.,VA,9823784,14-Nov-2019,RFA-RX-16-012,5I01RX002256-04,5,I01,VA,2256,4,,Unavailable,1-Jan-2017,31-Dec-2021,Rehabilitation Engineering & Prosthetics/Orthotics  (RRD5) ,,9947238,"DEAN, JESSE C.",Not Applicable,1,Unavailable,39807318,US,32.785074,-79.95378,481111,RALPH H JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER,CHARLESTON,SC,Independent Hospitals,29401-5703,UNITED STATES,,1-Jan-2020,31-Dec-2020,999,Research Projects,2020,,,,,

Transcatheter mitral valve repair; is a new class of technologiesin which MR repair is performed on a beating heart using a catheter that is guided to the mitral valve to deployreparative devices. However; the route to the mitral valve is a challenging path for existing catheters to followand hence the goal of this project is to develop a novel intravascular steerable robot that is guided to the mitralvalve by multimodality imaging and deploys a novel; low profile device that can effectively repair MR of allforms. ! !,NHLBI,9872201,1-Mar-2020,PA-16-160,5R01HL140325-03,5,R01,HL,140325,3,,"EVANS, FRANK",15-Mar-2018,28-Feb-2022,Biomedical Imaging Technology A Study Section (BMIT-A) ,,8002452,"DESAI, JAYDEV P.

Assistive robotic manipulators (ARMs)have emerged as a potential solution to mitigate the difficulties; frustration; and lost independence experiencedby these individuals. However; achieving effective and efficient control of an ARM has been a challenge due tothe less intuitive control. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a vision-based shared controlapproach for ARMs along with environment modifications to address the effectiveness and efficiency of ARMsfor real-world use.

We will focus on identifying site andmechanism of action by which steroids of relevance to human physiology and pathology interact with the protein subunits that conform potassium channels of the BK type in vascular smooth muscle; and address how this interaction leads to differential regulation of diameter in arteries of physiological and pathological relevance. We will use this information to obtain new; non-steroidal compounds which; while devoid of biological effects caused by the steroidal structure; either facilitate or oppose vasodilation; thus allowing us to tightly control blood flow to the target organs; and to pave the way for novel pharmaco-therapeutics of common diseases; including arterial hypertension; hypertensive encephalopathy; stroke; and cerebral vasospasm.,NHLBI,9894850,28-Jan-2020,PA-18-484,5R01HL147315-02,5,R01,HL,147315,2,,"OH, YOUNGSUK",20-Mar-2019,31-Jan-2023,"Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section (NTRC) ",,1861056,"DOPICO, ALEX M.",Not Applicable,9,PHARMACOLOGY,941884009,US,35.139758,-90.033697,578302,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,MEMPHIS,TN,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,38103-4903,UNITED STATES,,1-Feb-2020,31-Jan-2021,837,Research Projects,2020,NHLBI,420953,178747,599700,

High-resolution brain-machine interfaces withintracortical electrodes can be used to control computer cursors; robotic arms; or one?s own natural limbsthrough detection of one?s own thoughts. Unfortunately; the lack of reliability of recordings has prevented thistechnology from being readily available to our veterans. This proposal takes a multi-faceted approach toimproving the reliability of such brain implants by using novel technologies that prevent and treat theinflammatory response that causes implant failure. In doing so; the risk of using these brain-machine interfaceswill be drastically reduced; and will provide veterans and other individuals an opportunity to benefit from thistechnology. Additionally; technologies developed through this research program will improve the reliability andsafety of neural implants; such as deep brain stimulation devices and neural interfaces for sensory restoration.,VA,9881191,19-Feb-2020,RFA-RX-18-013,5I01RX003083-02,5,I01,VA,3083,2,,Unavailable,1-Apr-2019,31-Mar-2023,Rehabilitation Engineering & Prosthetics/Orthotics  (RRD5) ,,11209430,"DUNNING, ALLISON HESS ","CAPADONA, JEFFREY R",14,Unavailable,93016124,US,41.291464,-81.627169,481118,LOUIS STOKES CLEVELAND VA MEDICAL CENTER,CLEVELAND,OH,Independent Hospitals,44141-3204,UNITED STATES,,1-Apr-2020,31-Mar-2021,999,Research Projects,2020,,,,,

Undermining our efforts is a lack of understanding of how individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury maintain stability during the challenges of real-world walking and how to structure interventions to promote practice of specific mechanisms of stabilization. Our proposal will address these needs. First; we will quantify how individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury stabilize during maneuvers. Second; we will examine the effects robotic environments have to facilitate training of specific stabilization techniques. Collectively; outcomes from this research will advance our understanding of the balance impairments that need to be addressed to improve stability of individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury and how to optimize training interventions to effectively improve stability.

Direct stimulation of the spinal cord; either through implanted devices or surface stimulation; has beencombined with intense physical therapy assisted treadmill walking to facilitate independent standing andstepping. These current methods require 3-4 highly skilled therapists and may not be feasible in allrehabilitation settings; especially when considering the growing number of SCI patients each year. Therefore;the use of robotic exoskeleton suits combined with direct stimulation of the spinal cord (requiring 1-2therapists) may offer an alternative rehabilitation approach to overcome their limited abilities to stand and walk.Such improvements may also help to reverse or eliminate other health-related consequences associated withSCI.

This is very importantinformation in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visualimpairments; and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoringeye and body movements. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoorenvironments; taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements inthese contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks and requisite informationin natural locomotion; and the proposal attempts to specify these. The collection of integrated gaze; bodykinematics; and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative; as little comparable dataexists. The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo-deficient subjects for whom there is almostno integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should helpin development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information forindividuals with impaired vision.

Sanaria?s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccinesagainst malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials.The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based involves the extraction of salivary glands ofmosquitoes by dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first implement an interim semi-automated prototype for mosquito microdissection (sAMMS) in this key production step duringpharmaceutical manufacturing. In parallel we will investigate and develop a fully automatedsystem (fAMMS) for commercial-scale production to facilitate greater efficiencies; reducedtimeframes; greatly reduced training periods; increased product purity; and mitigation of humanerror and operator fatigue.

Obesity is a major risk factor for mobilityproblems. It is estimated that 11 million older adults have a mobility disability and four millionuse walking assistive devices. Dietary programs that restrict caloric intake have been successfulin achieving weight loss. However; some research has shown that weight loss can result in lossof muscle mass which may reduce physical function. This could be detrimental to older obeseVeterans with mobility disability. There has been little research on the effectiveness of acombined exercise and weight loss program in older obese Veterans who use assistive devices.We believe that our novel multimodality balance intervention along with a structured weight lossprogram will be effective at reducing weight and improving walking speed; balance; strength andquality of life in obese; older Veterans with mobility disability.,VA,9786077,21-Oct-2019,RFA-RX-16-003,5I01RX001813-04,5,I01,VA,1813,4,,Unavailable,1-Oct-2016,30-Sep-2020,Blank (RRD6) ,,1901034,"KATZEL, LESLIE I.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,796532609,US,39.289314,-76.623792,481039,BALTIMORE VA MEDICAL CENTER,BALTIMORE,MD,Independent Hospitals,21201-1524,UNITED STATES,,1-Oct-2019,30-Sep-2020,999,Research Projects,2020,,,,,

Deficits in ankle control after stroke can lead to foot drop; resulting in inefficient; aberrant gait and an elevated falls risk. Using a novel anke robot and newly invented adaptive control system; this study tests whether robotic assisted treadmill training will improve gait and balance functions in chronic stroke survivors with foot drop impairment. It is hypothesized that; compared to treadmill training alone; integrating adaptive ankle robotics with treadmill training will reduce drop foot during independent overground walking; resulting in greater mobility; improved postural control and reduced fall risk.The results may significantly impact stroke care in the VA system by giving clinicians a potent motor learning based treatment to address stroke induced foot drop and its associated risks.,VA,10174743,29-May-2020,RFA-RX-14-010,5I01RX001699-06,5,I01,VA,1699,6,,Unavailable,1-Jul-2015,31-Dec-2020,Musculoskeletal Health & Function (RRD2) ,,1958950,"KITTNER, STEVEN J",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,796532609,US,39.289314,-76.623792,481039,BALTIMORE VA MEDICAL CENTER,BALTIMORE,MD,Independent Hospitals,21201-1524,UNITED STATES,,1-Jul-2020,31-Dec-2020,999,Research Projects,2020,,,,,

These veterans are among the623;000 Americans who live with a major lower limb amputation; the majority of whom were of diabetic ordysvascular etiology (4 out of 5) and the remainder mostly due to trauma. Another several thousand; also oftraumatic etiology; stem from the U.S. involvement in enduring military conflicts overseas. These veterans haveall experienced a profound change in their lives. They walk slower and fall more often. Many incur injuries totheir residual limb. Few find wearing a prosthesis a comfortable. Why? Because the current state-of-the-art ofprosthetic restoration is no peer of the natural limb. My clinically-relevant research aims to improve theirmobility; reduce their risk of injury; and enhance their comfort by using innovative approaches to marry newtechnology with artisanal practice.,VA,9837355,27-Aug-2019,RFA-RX-18-017,5IK6RX002974-02,5,IK6,VA,2974,2,,Unavailable,1-Oct-2018,30-Sep-2023,Rehabilitation Engineering & Prosthetics/Orthotics  (RRD7) ,,8528166,"KLUTE, GLENN ",Not Applicable,9,Unavailable,20232971,US,47.563294,-122.312665,481094,VA PUGET SOUND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM,SEATTLE,WA,Independent Hospitals,98108-1532,UNITED STATES,,1-Oct-2019,30-Sep-2020,999,Others,2019,,,,,

We hypothesize that suboptimal strength and functional outcomes after ACL surgery are dueto the lack of task-specific exercise elements during strength training. This application seeks to assess whetherprogressive functional resistance training during gait will significantly improve quadriceps function; neuralexcitability; and knee mechanics during gait. The proposed studies will not only lay the foundation for a noveltraining paradigm; but will also improve our understanding of the mechanisms mediating neuromuscular andbiomechanical changes after functional resistance training.,NICHD,9534715,2-Aug-2018,PA-16-161,5R21HD092614-02,5,R21,HD,92614,2,,"CRUZ, THERESA",1-Sep-2017,31-Aug-2020,Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation Sciences Study Section (MRS) ,,11572652,"KRISHNAN, CHANDRAMOULI  ","PALMIERI-SMITH, RIANN MARIE",12,PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHAB,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,1506502,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2018,31-Aug-2020,865,Research Projects,2018,NICHD,125000,70000,195000,

We previously developed a novel training protocol that combined the ARMin and HandSOME exoskeletons. This is one of only a few arm exoskeletons that allow coordinated whole limb training in reach and grasp tasks with both virtual and real objects. However; the robot has a very large inertia and friction; and only gross grasp patterns are available. In development work; we will significantly modify the AMRin and HandSOME to deliver a state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton capable of retraining a wide range of functional activities.

Our overarching goal is to enhance the functionality on the widely-used commercial da Vinci Surgical platform by integrating an optical diagnostic port in their robotic surgical instruments. The fluorescence lifetime technique will provide real-time (few seconds) feedback on biochemical and functional tissue features during robotic surgical procedures without the administration of exogenous fluorescence contrast. The derived fluorescence parameters will provide surgeons with a rapid clinical assessment of local pathologies; identification of tumor margins and other relevant tissues; and guidance of biopsy during robotic-assisted surgery. This technology has the potential to improve the surgeon's ability to perform a complete surgical resection with low recurrence rates while preserving normal tissue and function. The current application focuses on robotic surgery of head and neck cancer. However; the technological developments and experimental methods developed in this application will serve as a paradigm for other applications of the da Vinci Surgical System including surgical therapy of urologic; colorectal; gynecologic; and thoracic cancers. Ultimately; the proposed technology has the potential to improve the survival rate and the quality of life for many cancer patients.,NCI,9781373,6-Sep-2019,PAR-13-169,5R01CA187427-06,5,R01,CA,187427,6,,"HARTSHORN, CHRISTOPHER",12-Sep-2014,31-Aug-2020,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-SBIB-J (57)R),,6647839,"MARCU, LAURA  ","FARWELL, DONALD GREGORY;SORGER, JONATHAN M",3,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,47120084,US,38.543675,-121.729989,577503,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,DAVIS,CA,SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING,95618-6153,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Aug-2020,394,Research Projects,2019,NCI,120247,68541,188788,

Barcoding willdramatically cut cost and increase the technical accuracy of the analysis of experiments with pooled mutants;greatly accelerating the discovery of target genes essential for survival of Salmonella in thousands of conditionsand environments; especially during infection.,NIAID,9746113,1-Aug-2019,PA-18-488,1R03AI139557-01A1,1,R03,AI,139557,1,A1,"ALEXANDER, WILLIAM A",2-Aug-2019,31-Jul-2021,Prokaryotic Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section (PCMB) ,,1878830,"MCCLELLAND, MICHAEL ",Not Applicable,45,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,46705849,US,33.678042,-117.773718,577504,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,92617-3213,UNITED STATES,,2-Aug-2019,31-Jul-2020,855,Research Projects,2019,NIAID,50000,28041,78041,

While many cases of NDDsare due to inherited mutations (the disease ?runs in the family?); recent research indicates thatexposure of the mother to pollution during pregnancy can cause NDDs in children that wouldotherwise be healthy. This is because development of the fetal brain is very sensitive to toxins. Inour assay; cells representing early stages of brain development will be cultured in the laboratory andtreated with compounds from the US EPA that are linked to NDDs. The cells will be photographedwith robotic microscopes and the images analyzed with computers to determine which compoundsmay alter neurodevelopment. Currently; testing for effects on brain development of the fetus is donewith animal testing. Our assay will be cheaper; more rapid; and more predictive than animal models(since it will use human cells); our assay will reduce the use of animals in toxicity research; which is abig problem; as hundreds of new compounds are developed; each year; for use in agriculture andmanufacturing; and help reduce the number of people afflicted with NDDs.,NIMH,9623072,8-Sep-2018,PA-17-148,1R41MH119621-01A1,1,R41,MH,119621,1,A1,"GRABB, MARGARET C",10-Sep-2018,9-Sep-2020,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-ETTN-P (13)B),,1882226,"MCDONOUGH, PATRICK M",Not Applicable,52,Unavailable,612181532,US,32.912304,-117.231839,4087401,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",SAN DIEGO,CA,Domestic For-Profits,92121-3225,UNITED STATES,,10-Sep-2018,9-Sep-2020,242,SBIR-STTR,2018,NIMH,,,300000,

The work proposed in this study aims to use a new set of syntheticmorphological tools that enable user-dictated control over cell-cell interaction to engineer islet cytoarchitectureand determine a set of design principles that govern how islet structure determines homeostatic function.,NIDDK,9992282,7-Feb-2020,PA-19-188,1F32DK123939-01A1,1,F32,DK,123939,1,A1,"CASTLE, ARTHUR",1-May-2020,30-Apr-2023,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-2 (J1)),,12640096,"MCKEITHAN, WESLEY LAWRENCE",Not Applicable,12,PHARMACOLOGY,94878337,US,37.78689,-122.448998,577508,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,94118-6215,UNITED STATES,,1-May-2020,30-Apr-2021,847,Training; Individual,2020,NIDDK,65310,,65310,

The primary cause of death for ALL occurs due to diseaserelapse. Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is considered the most powerful predictor of outcome inacute leukemias; including B type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). If clinicians could pinpoint when apatient?s minimum residual disease (MRD) begins rapid expansion to relapse; preemptive therapies can be takento dramatically improve patient outcome. In this Phase I/II application; a fully automated instrument that canprocess peripheral blood directly; search for circulating leukemic cells (CLCs) in pediatric ALL patients; anddetect relapse earlier than current techniques will be developed.

At one end of the spectrum there are the inevitable traumaticinjuries of combat; affecting young male and female warriors on active duty. At the other end of the spectrum;the aging veteran population is increasingly undergoing lower limb amputation secondary to peripheral arterialdisease. Regardless of cause; most veterans live for many years after amputation; and bear the significantdisabilities associated with losing one or more limbs. Despite the promise of current state-of-the-art roboticprostheses to replace missing limbs; control of these prostheses-complete with a sense of touch- remains afuturistic goal. To specifically address the urgent need for better prosthetic control; we have devised the novelOsseointegrated Neural Interface (ONI) that utilizes the medullary canal of the amputated limb to providedirect neural connection to an advanced prosthetic limb. Increasing the usability of upper and lower limbprostheses stands to greatly improve the quality of life for veterans.,VA,9836222,31-Oct-2019,RFA-RX-18-013,1I01RX003129-01A1,1,I01,VA,3129,1,A1,Unavailable,1-Nov-2019,31-Oct-2023,Rehabilitation Engineering & Prosthetics/Orthotics  (RRD5) ,,12143060,"POORE, SAMUEL ",Not Applicable,2,Unavailable,86683091,US,43.074038,-89.428928,481071,WM S.

Knowledge of their structures allows understanding of their functions in normal and diseased organisms; thus playing a central role in drug development. How the subunits combine to form this very complex machinery has been a central goal in biomedical research; and traditional X-ray and NMR methods have made great progress; but many proteins remain refractory to such technologies; resulting in a plethora of protein complexes having unknown structures. Here; we propose to develop a suite of new structural mass spectrometry strategies for analysis of protein complexes based on a combination of ion mobility; and chemical crosslinking; native mass spectrometry; and computational modeling. When integrated with radical labeling and hydrogen-deuterium exchange; such structural mass spectrometry has the ability to capture structure information from small amounts of unlabeled protein; present within complex mixtures that remain difficult or impossible to analyze using classical structural biology probes.,NIGMS,9626422,18-Jan-2019,PA-13-302,5R01GM095832-08,5,R01,GM,95832,8,,"KREPKIY, DMITRIY",1-Apr-2011,31-Jan-2021,Enabling Bioanalytical and Imaging Technologies Study Section (EBIT) ,,9844381,"RUOTOLO, BRANDON T ","ANDREWS, PHILIP C",12,BIOCHEMISTRY,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,1506502,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES,,1-Feb-2019,31-Jan-2021,859,Research Projects,2019,NIGMS,346153,185037,531190,

To prevent loss of function; we aim to understand the causes of and expand thetreatment of painful conditions of the foot such as arthritis and flatfoot. Additionally; we will reduce the risk ofamputation by studying factors that contribute to diabetic foot ulcers. For veterans whose amputation cannot beprevented; we aim to optimize patient/provider amputation level decision-making. Through the generation ofnovel prosthetic designs; we will augment function by reducing residual limb skin injury; enhance the thermalenvironment of the socket; and improve amputee mobility over complex terrains and transitions.

Patients may fail initial therapies (innate resistance) or experience drug resistant relapses (acquired resistance). We hypothesize that a direct to drug analysis of individual patients measuring over 80 clinically available; CTEP or promising clinical trial agents alone or in combination; will overcome innate or acquired resistance; improve response rates; lower unnecessary toxicity and reduce drug costs. To test this hypothesis we will identify the relationships between genomic or clinical characteristics of MM patient samples in light of their sensitivity and resistance to MM therapeutics. This strategy will also; for the purposes of this proposal; provide a database of samples and clinical data sets from which to explore genomic or clinical correlates of drug sensitivity and resistance in Projects 2 and 3.,NCI,9985242,30-Aug-2019,RFA-CA-17-009,4U54CA224018-02,4,U54,CA,224018,2,,Unavailable,,,Special Emphasis Panel (ZCA1-GRB-S),8402,6062161,"STEWART, ALEXANDER KEITH",Not Applicable,6,Unavailable,153665211,US,33.5825,-111.788135,4976104,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,Other Domestic Non-Profits,85259-5499,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Aug-2020,,Research Centers,2019,,243000,148500,,391500

The ?hybrid? system we propose derives the primary motive power forwalking by eliciting relatively short bursts of high intensity contractions from the otherwise paralyzed muscleswith electrical stimulation; and combines it with just enough external assistance from small; lightweight motorsat the hip and knee joints to ensure consistent stepping and curb/ramp ascent/descent. Unlike other poweredexoskeletons; our ?muscle-first? design adds to the maximal contributions of user; rather than backing offtotal assistance from external sources as voluntary effort is applied.

While many aspects of these processes are well understood; we are so far - due to the complexity of the processes taking place in vivo - unable to mimic the functions of the kidney using artificial devices. Thus; it is generally believed that any approach to replacekidney function will have to integrate in some way kidney cells. To avoid host immune responses and rejection; the cells should be ideally derived from the patient him/herself. However; conditions to generate the right cell types in sufficient amounts and purity are currently unavailable. In this proposal we will address this critical need. We will use state-of-th-art technology using a robotic- operated cell culture system coupled to a sophisticated software interface to identify conditions that allow the in vitro generation of multiple kidney cell types. e will then characterize those cells for their ability to perform some of the critical functions performed by the healthy kidney and even assemble them into kidney-like structures. Upon successful completion; the project will provide novel insights to resolve this important medical need for patients suffering from debilitating kidney diseases.,NIDDK,9778526,8-Aug-2019,RFA-DK-14-010,5UH3DK107357-05,5,UH3,DK,107357,5,,"HOSHIZAKI, DEBORAH K",23-Sep-2015,31-Aug-2020,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDK1-GRB-6 (M1)S),,8025217,"WESSELY, OLIVER  ","JENSEN, JAN ",11,OTHER BASIC SCIENCES,135781701,US,41.479276,-81.680233,10000858,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,CLEVELAND,OH,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,44195-0001,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Aug-2020,847,Research Projects,2019,NIDDK,252549,151951,404500,

The costs of rehabilitation are significant and practically limit therapy to the first few months after stroke onset. Recent result show clearly that patients with chronic stroke benefit from rehabilitation and robot assisted therapy offers a more cost effective approach to this patient group. An ongoing study has shown value in adding task related training to robotic training to improve functional recovery. The proposed study will expand the current study to examine the ability to predict who will benefit from this optimized therapy approach as well as expand knowledge of what brain structures and activity are important for improvement.,VA,10086003,28-May-2020,RFA-RX-14-010,5I01RX001667-05,5,I01,VA,1667,5,,Unavailable,1-Jul-2018,31-Dec-2020,Brain Health & Injury (RRD1) ,,1930520,"WITTENBERG, GEORGE F.",Not Applicable,18,Unavailable,33127569,US,40.479754,-79.90176,481080,VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION,PITTSBURGH,PA,Independent Hospitals,15240-1003,UNITED STATES,,1-Jul-2020,31-Dec-2020,999,Research Projects,2020,,,,,
