As a result of this work; weare now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher themolecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD; andhow these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.,NIDDK,9743790,8-Aug-2019,PA-16-160,5R01DK089201-08,5,R01,DK,89201,8,,"SILVA, CORINNE M",1-Aug-2012,30-Jun-2022,Pregnancy and Neonatology Study Section (PN) ,,8196581,"AAGAARD, KJERSTI MARIE",Not Applicable,9,OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY,51113330,US,29.711148,-95.39695

Many resuscitated victims diebefore hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury; yet ourability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited.

However; those who disclose aremore likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increasedHIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further; disclosing of one?s HIVstatus is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care; antiretroviral adherenceand decreased viral load. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system thatfeatures three virtual characters; two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a varietyof common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further refine andenhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature version to test via a multi-site; randomized controlled trial(RCT).,NIMH,9348065,9-Jun-2017,PA-14-197,2R44MH104102-03,2,R44,MH,104102,3,,"RAO, VASUDEV",1-Sep-2014,31-May-2020,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-AARR-G (10)B),,8949861,"ADAMS LARSEN, MARGO  ","HIGHTOW-WEIDMAN, LISA B",4,Unavailable,10776370,US,33.818297,-84.267097,3799701,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",DECATUR,GA,Domestic For-Profits,30033-3267,UNITED STATES,,14-Jun-2017,31-May-2018,242,SBIR-STTR,2017,NIMH,,,530730,

However; recent advancements in mobiletechnologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors?including emotional distress; social dysfunction;and sleep disturbance?which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short-term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore; the present study will leverage adolescents'naturalistic use of smartphone technology; along with advanced signal processing and computational modelingapproaches; to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents; whichultimately; may reduce needless loss of life.,NIMH,9773224,22-Jul-2019,RFA-OD-17-004,5U01MH116923-02,5,U01,MH,116923,2,,"MURPHY, ERIC ROUSSEAU",1-Sep-2018,31-Jul-2022,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-RPHB-V (51)R),,2081490,"ALLEN, NICHOLAS B ","AUERBACH, RANDY PATRICK",4,PSYCHOLOGY,079289626; 948117312,US,44.035646,-123.05255,6297005,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,EUGENE,OR,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,97403-5219,UNITED STATES,,1-Aug-2019,31-Jul-2020,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,753281,53417,721420,

Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spokenlanguage but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits(e.g.; Specific Language Impairment; Dyslexia; Autism; which together affect up to 16% of children) have beenshown to have deficits in word recognition; making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of wordrecognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent withthe early acoustic input; and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time. Our projectwill develop and optimize a new method in which machine learning tools are used to decode EEG-basedneural signals to characterize the time-course of competition.

The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse andHIV; with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers canenact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood canbe prevented. The concepts learned through this grant; as well as the career development pursued by theinvestigator; will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead toinnovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.,NIDA,9636556,18-Jan-2019,PA-14-044,5K01DA041620-03,5,K01,DA,41620,3,,"WEINBERG, NAIMAH Z",15-Feb-2017,31-Jan-2022,Addiction Risks and Mechanisms Study Section (ARM) ,,11361613,"BEAL, SARAH ",Not Applicable,1,Unavailable,71284913,US,39.140882,-84.500494,615001,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,CINCINNATI,OH,Independent Hospitals,45229-3039,UNITED STATES,,1-Feb-2019,31-Jan-2020,279,Other Research-Related,2019,NIDA,156016,12481,168497,

Our goal is to create a computerized system for detecting andcharacterizing an individual's anomia; which will open the door to new ways of treating anomia and reduceclinical workload.,NIDCD,9741676,6-Aug-2019,PA-16-160,5R01DC015999-02,5,R01,DC,15999,2,,"COOPER, JUDITH",1-Sep-2018,31-Aug-2023,Language and Communication Study Section (LCOM) ,,9486111,"BEDRICK, STEVEN  ","FERGADIOTIS, GERASIMOS ",3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,96997515,US,45.499316,-122.688464,6297007,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,97239-3098,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Aug-2020,173,Research Projects,2019,NIDCD,490516,127250,229378,

New promising analytical methods started emerging;which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability andhealth care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome; consisting ofmultiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method forCOPD subtyping. We will apply; test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohortsof COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identifypatient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors andcausal variants for the disease progression in each subtype. ,NHLBI,9678366,1-Apr-2019,RFA-HL-17-011,5U01HL137159-03,5,U01,HL,137159,3,,"GAN, WEINIU",18-Apr-2017,31-Mar-2021,Special Emphasis Panel (ZHL1-CSR-Q (F1)),,8019070,"BENOS, PANAGIOTIS V ","SCIURBA, FRANK ",18,BIOLOGY,4514360,US,40.444001,-79.956102,2059802,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,15260-3203,UNITED STATES,,1-Apr-2019,31-Mar-2021,838,Research Projects,2019,NHLBI,680576,367231,602448,

In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted aslong as a year; but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder(TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure andfunction in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of ticdisappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation; MRI;and neuropsychological measures; and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTDcan be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from twomatching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics; and children whohave had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle onresearch into Tourette syndrome; in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosisfor children who just started ticcing.,NIMH,9717307,10-Jun-2019,PA-16-160,5R01MH104030-03,5,R01,MH,104030,3,,"PRABHAKAR, JANANI",9-Jun-2017,31-May-2022,Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section (CPDD) ,,1882590,"BLACK, KEVIN J",Not Applicable,1,PSYCHIATRY,68552207,US,38.647241,-90.300814,9083901,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,63130-4862,UNITED STATES,,1-Jun-2019,31-May-2020,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,471009,212532,683541,

Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not presentwith psychiatric chief complaints; universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups;such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however; two trenchant barriersprevent such universal screening from being widely implemented; namely; (1) lack of clarity around the specificindicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to agrinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address thesetwo barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards andprocedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs; thereby revolutionizing the field's ability toactualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective; efficient identification and triagingof suicide risk; both hidden and obvious.,NIMH,9638873,16-Jan-2019,PA-18-484,1R01MH118220-01,1,R01,MH,118220,1,,"FREED, MICHAEL",1-Mar-2019,30-Nov-2022,Mental Health Services Research Committee (SERV) ,,7362403,"BOUDREAUX, EDWIN D ","WANG, BO ",2,EMERGENCY MEDICINE,603847393,US,42.277722,-71.759339,850903,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,WORCESTER,MA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,01655-0002,UNITED STATES,,1-Mar-2019,30-Nov-2019,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,503751,340032,843783,

When results on the safety of interventions; such as drugs; are notproperly disseminated; patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timelyreporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov); representing a novel data type that could beused for drug safety surveillance. However; the use of these data has remained limited to date.

These three approaches; namely;computerized adaptive testing; assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leadingtheories of suicide; and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors ofsuicidal behavior found in electronic health records; have to potential to be much briefer and more accuratethan current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents.Therefore; this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidalbehavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.,NIMH,9743863,8-Apr-2019,PA-16-160,5R01MH100155-07,5,R01,MH,100155,7,,"O'CONNOR, STEPHEN",27-May-2013,31-Mar-2023,Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section (CPDD) ,,1894913,"BRENT, DAVID A.

We use modern computing techniques calledmachine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals andthat can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer testbased on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation andbehavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work; it will advance clinical practice by improvingclinicians? ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk; (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelingsrelated to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patientsbased on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidalrisk.,NIMH,9716663,27-Mar-2019,PA-16-160,5R01MH116652-02,5,R01,MH,116652,2,,"ZALCMAN, STEVEN J",6-Jun-2018,31-Mar-2023,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-BBBP-J (02)M),,1894913,"BRENT, DAVID A.

While averageglycaemia has long been the key indicator for judging the quality of achieved glucose control; glucose variability(or the measure of glucose fluctuations in time) is typically at the root of clinicians' inability to safely achievenear-normal average glycaemia. Our project; in its 5th installment; has aimed at understanding the sources andmechanism of glucose variability (GV); and providing technological and behavioral solutions to control (reduce)it in T1DM. Following the success of several pilot trials of Decision Support Systems (DSS); we now propose tovalidate these approaches in a larger population and for significantly longer periods of time; and contrast theefficacy of providing information vs. advice to patients with T1DM; in so doing we will understand the impact ofthe patients' psycho-behavioral profile on the effectiveness of these interventions and design and validate a newindex capable of tracking the trust and acceptance of a DSS user.,NIDDK,9739631,28-Mar-2019,PA-18-330,2R01DK051562-19A1,2,R01,DK,51562,19,A1,"ARREAZA-RUBIN, GUILLERMO",24-Jul-1996,31-Jan-2024,"Behavioral Medicine, Interventions and Outcomes Study Section (BMIO) ",,9342293,"BRETON, MARC D",Not Applicable,5,PSYCHIATRY,65391526,US,38.034207,-78.512346,1526402,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,22904-4195,UNITED STATES,,1-Apr-2019,31-Jan-2020,847,Research Projects,2019,NIDDK,434579,267266,701845,

Although population genomic studies would provide the analyticalresolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales ? preciselythe scales at which these processes occur ? microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by thepracticalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative;cost-effective; practical; and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomicDNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.,NIAID,9699440,18-Apr-2019,PA-16-161,5R21AI137433-02,5,R21,AI,137433,2,,"GEZMU, MISRAK",16-May-2018,30-Apr-2021,"Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section (GCAT) ",,8612956,"BRISSON, DUSTIN ",Not Applicable,3,BIOLOGY,42250712,US,39.952982,-75.192768,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,19104-6205,UNITED STATES,,1-May-2019,30-Apr-2021,855,Research Projects,2019,NIAID,144855,41246,186101,

However this is just the beginning. In this renewal; we will build on andsignificantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamicand potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order toenable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will alsodisseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data.37,NIBIB,9776502,6-Aug-2019,PA-13-302,5R01EB006841-13,5,R01,EB,6841,13,,"DUAN, QI",1-Apr-2007,31-Aug-2020,Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies Study Section (NOIT) ,,7117069,"CALHOUN, VINCE D ","PLIS, SERGEY ",5,PSYCHOLOGY,837322494,US,33.762977,-84.42296,676604,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,30302-3999,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Aug-2020,286,Research Projects,2019,NIBIB,258900,141100,400000,

Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machinelearning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work; we propose toaccelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. Inparticular; we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee thatquantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machinelearning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radicalprostatectomy.,NCI,9653979,24-Jan-2019,PAR-15-075,5R01CA218187-02,5,R01,CA,218187,2,,"REDMOND, GEORGE O",21-Feb-2018,31-Jan-2023,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-SBIB-Q (57)R),,9642137,"CATANA, CIPRIAN ",Not Applicable,8,Unavailable,73130411,US,42.347465,-71.082058,4907701,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,02114-2696,UNITED STATES,,1-Feb-2019,31-Jan-2020,394,Research Projects,2019,NCI,444990,218756,663746,

The goal of this study is toidentify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data andstructural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predictwho will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acutephase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who arelikely to have PTH persistence. ,NINDS,9829475,16-Aug-2019,RFA-NS-18-041,1R61NS113315-01,1,R61,NS,113315,1,,"PELLEYMOUNTER, MARY A",1-Sep-2019,31-Jul-2022,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-ETTN-C (50)R),,14103225,"CHONG, CATHERINE DANIELA",Not Applicable,6,Unavailable,153665211,US,33.5825,-111.788135,4976104,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,Other Domestic Non-Profits,85259-5499,UNITED STATES,,1-Sep-2019,31-Jul-2022,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,2296681,855652,3152333,

Unfortunately; however; there has not been acommensurate development of the tools needed to share; validate; and compare such models; or integratethem into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing astandard software platform for the construction; documentation; sharing; and integration of computationalmodels of brain function; that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise tomental function and; critically; the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced bydisturbances of individual subsystems ? disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor inneurological and psychiatric disorders.,NIMH,9824928,11-Jul-2019,PA-18-350,1R21MH117548-01A1,1,R21,MH,117548,1,A1,"FERRANTE, MICHELE",15-Jul-2019,30-Apr-2021,Emerging Imaging Technologies in Neuroscience Study Section (EITN) ,,1862686,"COHEN, JONATHAN D",Not Applicable,12,PSYCHOLOGY,2484665,US,40.12273,-74.703461,6661401,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,PRINCETON,NJ,OTHER DOMESTIC HIGHER EDUCATION,08543-0036,UNITED STATES,,15-Jul-2019,30-Apr-2020,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,175981,77817,253798,

The presence of noise or reverberation in the listening environment decreases speech comprehension for CI users much more rapidly than for normal-hearing listeners; and of these two conditions; reverberation has a greater negative impact. The proposed research aims to provide a robust reverberation mitigation algorithm for CI speech processors thereby improving the ability of CI users to interact in real-world listening environments.,NIDCD,9722203,6-Jun-2019,PA-13-302,5R01DC014290-05,5,R01,DC,14290,5,,"MILLER, ROGER",1-Jul-2015,30-Jun-2021,Auditory System Study Section (AUD) ,,1883728,"COLLINS, LESLIE M.",Not Applicable,1,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),44387793,US,36.006824,-78.924579,2221101,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,SCHOOLS OF ENGINEERING,27705-4673,UNITED STATES,,1-Jul-2019,30-Jun-2021,173,Research Projects,2019,NIDCD,212500,113899,326399,

We have developed a next-generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brainorganizes behavior; however; using this approach requires substantial expertise; which has slowed its adoptionby the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code; and to offerhands-on training; so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily useMoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes; drugs or neural activitychanges action.,NINDS,9654850,28-Mar-2019,RFA-NS-18-005,1U24NS109520-01,1,U24,NS,109520,1,,"CAPORELLO, EMILY LAURA",1-Apr-2019,31-Jan-2025,Special Emphasis Panel (ZNS1-SRB-M (06)),,1892479,"DATTA, SANDEEP R",Not Applicable,7,BIOLOGY,47006379,US,42.335814,-71.105033,3212902,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,BOSTON,MA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,02115-6027,UNITED STATES,,1-Apr-2019,31-Jan-2021,853,Other Research-Related,2019,NINDS,269278,186377,455655,

The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized; adaptive; and proac-tive illness management strategies; inform better nosology; and assist the adoption of improved evidence-basedcare approaches to diminish the severity of relapses; or prevent their occurrence altogether.,NIMH,9739933,12-Apr-2019,PAR-17-264,1R01MH117172-01A1,1,R01,MH,117172,1,A1,"AZRIN, SUSAN",15-Apr-2019,28-Feb-2023,Mental Health Services Research Committee (SERV) ,,12110191,"DE CHOUDHURY, MUNMUN ",Not Applicable,5,BIOSTATISTICS & OTHER MATH SCI,97394084,US,33.762977,-84.42296,676603,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,ATLANTA,GA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,30332-0415,UNITED STATES,,15-Apr-2019,29-Feb-2020,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,516231,166019,682250,

The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolardisorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of amicroRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specificbiomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalizedtreatments.,NIMH,9822873,5-Jul-2019,PA-18-350,1R21MH117636-01A1,1,R21,MH,117636,1,A1,"MEINECKE, DOUGLAS L",5-Jul-2019,30-Apr-2021,Behavioral Genetics and Epidemiology Study Section (BGES) ,,12208671,"DE QUEVEDO, JOAO L",Not Applicable,9,PSYCHIATRY,800771594,US,29.798149,-95.369119,578417,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,HOUSTON,TX,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,77030-5400,UNITED STATES,,5-Jul-2019,30-Apr-2020,242,Research Projects,2019,NIMH,125000,67500,192500,

However; assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional; which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution; by designing; implementing; and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall; picture naming; sentence repetition; sentence completion; and nonword repetition.,NIDCD,9600692,19-Nov-2018,PAR-14-009,5R01DC013996-04,5,R01,DC,13996,4,,"COOPER, JUDITH",10-Dec-2015,30-Nov-2020,Special Emphasis Panel (ZDC1-SRB-K (12)),,14661101,"DOLATA, JILL KALAT ","ASGARI, MEYSAM ",3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,96997515,US,45.499316,-122.688464,6297007,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,97239-3098,UNITED STATES,,1-Dec-2018,30-Nov-2019,173,Research Projects,2019,NIDCD,383323,184898,568221,

However; these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g.; brief workshops); or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time; resource; and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g.; adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging; affordable; standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool; the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general; and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular; if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such; the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition; by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment; the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science; sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies; which could; in turn; help them save lives.          ,NIMH,8299002,29-May-2012,PAR-09-132,5R36MH095417-02,5,R36,MH,95417,2,,"HILL, LAUREN D",8-Jul-2011,15-Oct-2014,Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-B (02)),,10717687,"DUVIVIER, LETICIA ",Not Applicable,27,PSYCHOLOGY,625174149,US,25.71188,-80.284456,5221201,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,CORAL GABLES,FL,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,33146-2926,UNITED STATES,,1-Jun-2012,15-Oct-2014,242,Research Projects,2012,NIMH,36180,2894,39074,

Yet; some of the challengeswith developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoidingothers that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in thepublic domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possibleto use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule?s properties fromstructure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict usingvarious machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions fora natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liabilityassessment.

Many palliative drugs are available for the disease but there is still anurgent need for curative drugs with greater efficacy. We need to understand the key factors involved in diseaseprogression and their suitability as drug targets for discovering new drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic;symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently; there is nosatisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of theregional distribution of centrilobular; panlobular; and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on theirassociations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes; their genetic determinants; and their ability toimprove prediction of COPD disease progression; above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical;radiographic; and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who willremain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selectingpatients for specific therapeutic interventions.,NHLBI,9672582,9-Jul-2019,PA-16-191,5K08HL141601-02,5,K08,HL,141601,2,,"LU, QING",1-Jul-2018,30-Jun-2023,Special Emphasis Panel (MCBS (JA)),,14093376,"EL BOUEIZ, ADEL ",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,30811269,US,42.334978,-71.105987,1080401,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,02115-6110,UNITED STATES,,1-Jul-2019,30-Jun-2020,838,Other Research-Related,2019,NHLBI,157999,12640,170639,

The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease; and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.        ,NIEHS,8319377,19-Jul-2012,PA-10-069,5R21ES019713-02,5,R21,ES,19713,2,,"JOUBERT, BONNIE",15-Aug-2011,31-Jul-2014,"Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section (IRAP) ",,7681923,"FARUQUE, FAZLAY S",Not Applicable,3,OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS,928824473,US,32.328724,-90.175537,5390304,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,JACKSON,MS,SCHOOLS OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,39216-4500,UNITED STATES,,1-Aug-2012,31-Jul-2014,113,Research Projects,2012,NIEHS,104032,41824,145856,
